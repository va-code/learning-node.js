Why do I want to get a better understanding of node.js?
	-Better understanding of web aplications
	-Join front end, and backend into one language to control websites
	-Easier pathway to WEBASSEMBLY, which I want to understand for lower level operations

What can node do?
	threading/multicore?
		runs multithread on the backeend..
		how do you get to those juuicy theads?
			"cluster" module

		multithread workers:
			will each accept a process and complete the process

		If you are using multithreading you should:
			- use nginx or apache to limit connections, rewrite urls, etc so PC doesn't overdo it
			- recycle workers to remove memory leaks
			- set up logging and monitering 

	bring frontend and backend under the same umbrella
	node.js is just a way to running .js scripts without a browser







What kind of projects do I want to use node.js for?
	might be fun to try making a simple CAD software...
	minecraft bots
	website redesign??? who know


Javascript frameworks
