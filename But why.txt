Why do I want to get a better understanding of node.js?
	-Better understanding of web aplications
	-Join front end, and backend into one language to control websites
	-Easier pathway to WEBASSEMBLY, which I want to understand for lower level operations

What can node do?
	threading/multicore?
		runs multithread on the backeend..
		how do you get to those juuicy theads?
			"cluster" module

		multithread workers:
			will each accept a process and complete the process

		If you are using multithreading you should:
			- use nginx or apache to limit connections, rewrite urls, etc so PC doesn't overdo it
			- recycle workers to remove memory leaks
			- set up logging and monitering 

	bring frontend and backend under the same umbrella
	node.js is just a way to running .js scripts without a browser







What kind of projects do I want to use node.js for?
	might be fun to try making a simple CAD software...
	minecraft bots
	website redesign??? who know


Javascript frameworks

	Vue.js

		seperates ui and logic
	Angular.js
		good for single page applications
		more in the box solutions
		application development used for many
		capable cli for newer clint side devs
		high learning vurve
		breaks often from updates
		has required typescript stuff
	react.js
		facebooks: simplifies building interactive UIs
		uses jsx(xml in javascript) and will need extended with libraries
		more stable

	what is Typescript?	
		strongly typed superset of javascript
		compiles to just regular javascript
