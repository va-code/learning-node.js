Using NPM:

:terminal:
```
$ npm isntall vite@latest

$ npm init vite@latest
	->name_project

	->vanilla
		->vanilla
$ cd name_project
/name_project/$ npm install
/name_project/$ npm run dev
```

from there replace relavant files with those from '/src changes/'

Results:
	Website should have a box model on the left and a dragon model on the right held within a canvas in the HTML. Both objects will be rotating around 'magically'. Other small things here and there.
