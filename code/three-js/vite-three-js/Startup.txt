Using NPM:

:bash:

$npm isntall vite@latest

$npm init vite@latest
	->name_project

	->vanilla
		->javascript

from there replace relavant files with those from '/src changes/'

Resulting Website should have a box model on the left and a dragon model on the right held within a canvas in the HTML. Both objects will be rotating around 'magically'. Other small things here and there.
